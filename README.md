# XSS-2500-Payload-List

**This payload list is super helpful for Security Researchers and Penetration Testers.**

Hello everyone 👋  
I made an **XSS payload list** for you, a curated collection of XSS payloads gathered from various websites and pages.  
This repo contains **advanced JavaScript & HTML payloads**, **context tags**, and a few **safe demo fixtures** to help with automation and fuzzing.  
Use it **only for authorized testing and bug bounty research**.
