# XSS-2500-Payload-list-
This Payload is super helpful for Security Researchers and Penetration Testers.

Hello everyone , I made XSS payload list for you: a curated collection of XSS payloads gathered from various websites and pages.
This repo contains advanced JavaScript & HTML payloads, context tags, and a few safe demo fixtures to help automation and fuzzing. Use it only for authorized testing on bug hunting 


Download the repo and view the list:

//# clone repo (replace <repo-url> with your repo)
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/xss-payloads.git
cd xss-payloads
ls
cat payloads.txt
//
Short note (must-read)

Only test on systems you own or have permission to test. Responsible disclosure only.


One-line for resume

Curated an advanced, context-tagged XSS payload corpus (automation-ready) to improve fuzzing coverage and speed up responsible bug-bounty discovery.

Want it even shorter (tweet-size) or want me to format this as a one-file README.md you can paste directly?
